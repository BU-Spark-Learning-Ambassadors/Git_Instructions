## Step 0:
This is a Spark! microchallenge for getting familiar with git!  
This is called a repository. Repositories are used to store files and to store several different commits, or versions of your code. During development, you often want to commit your code to show your process from the ground up. you also want might want to update working code into a new version, while also keeping a previous version.  
In our repository, we have a few files; our README.md file, which is the file you are reading right now, and our Sort.java file, which is a java file that sorts a given array. You are going to be using github commands in VSCode to edit these files and create new files.
