# SparkGitMicrochallenge

## INFO:
This is a Spark! microchallenge for getting familiar with git!  
This is called a repository. Repositories are used to store files and to store several different commits, or versions of your code. During development, you often want to commit your code to show your process from the ground up. You also might want to update working code into a new version, while also keeping a previous version.  
In our repository, we have a few files; our **README.md** file, which is the file you are reading right now, and our **Sort.java** file, which is a java file that sorts a given array. You are going to be using GitHub commands in VSCode to edit these files and create new files.

## Step 0: Clone the repository
You are going to clone the repository using a **codespace**. to do this, click on the green **button** that says **code**, and copy the HTTPS key. Then, move over to Codespaces, and create a Codespace. In the terminal, type ` git clone [key]`, where you replace [key] with the key you just copied (don't include brackets!)
